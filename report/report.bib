However, the doses available in 2021 are likely to be limited. We extend a mathematical model of SARS-CoV-2 transmission across different country settings to evaluate the public health impact of potential vaccines using WHO-developed target product profiles. We identify optimal vaccine allocation strategies within- and between-countries to maximise averted deaths under constraints on dose supply. We find that the health impact of SARS-CoV-2 vaccination depends on the cumulative population-level infection incidence when vaccination begins, the duration of natural immunity, the trajectory of the epidemic prior to vaccination, and the level of healthcare available to effectively treat those with disease. Within a country we find that for a limited supply (doses for~{$<~$}20\% of the population) the optimal strategy is to target the elderly. However, with a larger supply, if vaccination can occur while other interventions are maintained, the optimal strategy switches to targeting key transmitters to indirectly protect the vulnerable. As supply increases, vaccines that reduce or block infection have a greater impact than those that prevent disease alone due to the indirect protection provided to high-risk groups. Given a 2 billion global dose supply in 2021, we find that a strategy in which doses are allocated to countries proportional to population size is close to optimal in averting deaths and aligns with the ethical principles agreed in pandemic preparedness planning.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: The first COVID-19 vaccine outside a clinical trial setting was administered on Dec 8, 2020. To ensure global vaccine equity, vaccine targets were set by the COVID-19 Vaccines Global Access (COVAX) Facility and WHO. However, due to vaccine shortfalls, these targets were not achieved by the end of 2021. We aimed to quantify the global impact of the first year of COVID-19 vaccination programmes. METHODS: A mathematical model of COVID-19 transmission and vaccination was separately fit to reported COVID-19 mortality and all-cause excess mortality in 185 countries and territories. The impact of COVID-19 vaccination programmes was determined by estimating the additional lives lost if no vaccines had been distributed. We also estimated the additional deaths that would have been averted had the vaccination coverage targets of 20\% set by COVAX and 40\% set by WHO been achieved by the end of 2021. FINDINGS: Based on official reported COVID-19 deaths, we estimated that vaccinations prevented 14{$\cdot$}4 million (95\% credible interval [Crl] 13{$\cdot$}7-15{$\cdot$}9) deaths from COVID-19 in 185 countries and territories between Dec 8, 2020, and Dec 8, 2021. This estimate rose to 19{$\cdot$}8 million (95\% Crl 19{$\cdot$}1-20{$\cdot$}4) deaths from COVID-19 averted when we used excess deaths as an estimate of the true extent of the pandemic, representing a global reduction of 63\% in total deaths (19{$\cdot$}8 million of 31{$\cdot$}4 million) during the first year of COVID-19 vaccination. In COVAX Advance Market Commitment countries, we estimated that 41\% of excess mortality (7{$\cdot$}4 million [95\% Crl 6{$\cdot$}8-7{$\cdot$}7] of 17{$\cdot$}9 million deaths) was averted. In low-income countries, we estimated that an additional 45\% (95\% CrI 42-49) of deaths could have been averted had the 20\% vaccination coverage target set by COVAX been met by each country, and that an additional 111\% (105-118) of deaths could have been averted had the 40\% target set by WHO been met by each country by the end of 2021. INTERPRETATION: COVID-19 vaccination has substantially altered the course of the pandemic, saving tens of millions of lives globally. However, inadequate access to vaccines in low-income countries has limited the impact in these settings, reinforcing the need for global vaccine equity and coverage.

  abstract = {The COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in substantial mortality worldwide. However, to date, countries in the Middle East and Africa have reported considerably lower mortality rates than in Europe and the Americas. Motivated by reports of an overwhelmed health system, we estimate the likely under-ascertainment of COVID-19 mortality in Damascus, Syria. Using all-cause mortality data, we fit a mathematical model of COVID-19 transmission to reported mortality, estimating that 1.25\% of COVID-19 deaths (sensitivity range 1.00\% \textendash{} 3.00\%) have been reported as of 2 September 2020. By 2 September, we estimate that 4,380 (95\% CI: 3,250 \textendash{} 5,550) COVID-19 deaths in Damascus may have been missed, with 39.0\% (95\% CI: 32.5\% \textendash{} 45.0\%) of the population in Damascus estimated to have been infected. Accounting for under-ascertainment corroborates reports of exceeded hospital bed capacity and is validated by community-uploaded obituary notifications, which confirm extensive unreported mortality in Damascus., Reported COVID-19 mortality rates have been relatively low in Syria, but there has been concern about overwhelmed health systems. Here, the authors use community mortality indicators and estimate that {$<$}3\% of COVID-19 deaths in Damascus were reported as of 2 September 2020.},
